                        <p className="values-system-para mt-2">
                            The Children’s Complaints Office (CCO) has been established at the Secretariat of the Provincial Ombudsman Sindh (POS) by way of a partnership between the POS and UNICEF.
                            It was observed that there was no dedicated forum for receiving and resolving Children-related complaints in Sindh; no public accountability of institutions charged with the responsibility for protecting Children’s Rights in Pakistan’s four Provinces.
                        </p>
                        <p className="values-system-para mt-2">
                            Thus the CCO initiative bridges an existing gap in terms of a Children-specific grievance redress mechanism in the administrative justice sector in Sindh and also accords Sindh the privilege of establishing the first Children’s Regional Ombudsman office in Asia (and the second after Pakistan’s federal Ombudsman).

                            The institution of the Provincial Ombudsman Sindh (POS) was created in 1991 under the Establishment of the Office of Ombudsman for the Province of Sindh Act, 1991 (Sindh Act No. 1 of 1992). The main task of the POS is to diagnose, investigate, redress and rectify any injustice done to a person through maladministration by any officer or agency of the Government of Sindh. Like all Ombudsman institutions, the POS exists to promote accountability, transparency and integrity in governance.
